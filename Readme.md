# Node Project Structure Generator

This batch file (`nodeProject.bat`) helps you quickly generate a standard Node.js project structure. It prompts for a project name and sets up the necessary folders and files for a Node.js application.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Usage

1. **Run the Batch File**:
    ### Directly 
    - Double click on the bat file to get started
    ### Using CMD
   - Open Command Prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the batch file is located.
   - Execute the batch file by typing:
     ```cmd
     create_node_structure.bat
     ```

2. **Enter Project Name**:
   - When prompted, enter the desired name for your project. The batch file will create a directory with this name and set up the project structure inside it.


## Notes

- The `package.json` and `.env` files are generated with basic placeholders. You should update these files with your actual configuration and dependencies.
- The script also generates a basic `app.js` file to get you started with Express.js.
